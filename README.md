# fuzzyhttp

Fuzzyhttp is a bash script that will take a URL and output a the HTTP Header response for each HTTP response type. Currently it will not attempt a `DELETE` request. This is to avoid accidental data loss. 

# POC

To run the script, simply enter the following command:
`./fuzzyhttp`

It will then prompt you for the URL you would like to test and then output the results.
