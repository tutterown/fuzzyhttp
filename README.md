# fuzzyhttp

Fuzzyhttp is a bash script that will take a URL and output a curl for each of the HTTP requst types. Currently it will not attempt a `DELETE` request to avoid accidental data loss

# POC

To run the script, simply enter the following command:
`./fuzzyhttp`

It will then prompt you for the URL you would like to test and then output the results.
